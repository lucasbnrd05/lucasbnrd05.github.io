        <h2 data-aos="fade-up">Introduction</h2>

        <p data-aos="fade-up">Our video game, Les maisons aux âmes perdues, was born from a shared passion for storytelling and gaming. We wanted to create a captivating and immersive experience that blends mystery, exploration, and puzzles. From the very beginning, we worked together to craft a unique concept: a haunting journey through mysterious houses, each holding the memories of lost souls. We divided tasks based on our strengths—some of us focused on programming and game mechanics, while others worked on designing environments, creating sound effects, and writing the storyline. Throughout the process, we explored new tools, experimented with different game engines, and learned to solve complex problems together. It was a true team effort, driven by creativity and determination.</p>

        <h2 data-aos="fade-up">Challenge</h2>


        <p data-aos="fade-up">Developing Les maisons aux âmes perdues wasn’t without its challenges. One major obstacle was creating an engaging atmosphere with realistic visuals and immersive sound effects, which required both technical skills and artistic vision. We also faced difficulties in balancing gameplay mechanics to ensure that the puzzles were challenging but not frustrating. Optimizing performance was another hurdle, as we had to reduce loading times and fix bugs to make the game run smoothly. Additionally, coordinating our work as a team, especially when facing tight deadlines, tested our communication and time-management skills. Despite these difficulties, we stayed motivated, knowing that each challenge brought us closer to completing our vision.</p>

        <h2 data-aos="fade-up">Solutions</h2>


        <p data-aos="fade-up">To overcome these challenges, we adopted a collaborative and solution-focused approach. We chose a game engine that suited our needs and allowed us to work efficiently together. To enhance the atmosphere, we used high-quality sound effects and lighting techniques to create a mysterious and immersive environment. For gameplay balance, we organized playtesting sessions, gathering feedback to improve puzzles and mechanics. We also optimized the game's performance by refining our code and compressing assets without sacrificing quality. Communication was key: we held regular meetings, used project management tools to track our progress, and divided tasks clearly to maximize productivity. Every challenge became an opportunity to learn, adapt, and grow as a team.</p>
