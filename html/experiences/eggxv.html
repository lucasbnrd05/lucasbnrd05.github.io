        <h2 data-aos="fade-up">Introduction</h2>

        <p data-aos="fade-up">When I joined EGG XV as a rugby instructor, I knew I was stepping into an exciting and meaningful role. My mission was to supervise children aged 4 to 14, helping them learn and enjoy the sport while ensuring their safety and development. From the very first session, I felt the responsibility of being a guide and a role model for these young players. I was involved in all aspects of the training sessions: setting up the pitch, preparing equipment, welcoming players, and leading warm-ups and drills. Beyond the field, I also participated in team meetings with other coaches to plan sessions, exchange ideas, and continuously improve our methods. This experience became more than a job; it was a journey of learning, sharing, and growing.</p>

        <h2 data-aos="fade-up">Challenge</h2>


        <p data-aos="fade-up">During my time at EGG XV, I encountered several challenges that tested my adaptability and leadership skills. Managing groups of children with different ages, abilities, and personalities required patience and creativity. Some players were shy or hesitant, while others were more energetic and needed structure. Keeping them engaged, motivated, and disciplined during training sessions was not always easy. Additionally, preparing the pitch and organizing equipment under time constraints, especially during busy tournament days, demanded efficiency and attention to detail. Another challenge was communication—both with the children and their parents—ensuring everyone felt welcome, informed, and part of the team. Despite these difficulties, I approached each challenge with determination and a willingness to learn.</p>

        <h2 data-aos="fade-up">Solutions</h2>


        <p data-aos="fade-up">To overcome these challenges, I developed strategies that combined organization, creativity, and teamwork. I adapted my coaching style to suit the age and personality of the children, using fun and engaging drills to capture their attention while teaching them key rugby skills. I introduced games and challenges to keep sessions exciting and rewarding, encouraging teamwork and sportsmanship. To manage the pitch and equipment effectively, I created a setup routine that allowed me to prepare quickly and efficiently. I also worked closely with other coaches, sharing feedback and ideas during team meetings to improve our sessions. When communicating with parents, I made sure to be approachable, informative, and transparent, which helped build trust and a positive environment. These solutions not only resolved the challenges but also made me a more confident and capable instructor.</p>

I learned how to adapt my approach to different situations, how to motivate a team, and how to resolve conflicts constructively.

Additionally, managing the logistics of each session, from equipment to schedules, improved my organizational and time-management skills. Most importantly, I discovered the joy of sharing my passion for rugby and inspiring the next generation of players.</p>
